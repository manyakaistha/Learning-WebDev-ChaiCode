# Day 2: HTML Intermediate Concepts

## Overview
This section builds on the HTML fundamentals from Day 1, introducing more complex elements and attributes for creating structured web content.

## Key Concepts
1. HTML Forms
   - Form elements (form, input, textarea)
   - Input types (text, email, password, etc.)
   - Form attributes (action, method)
   - Form validation

2. Tables
   - Basic table structure (table, tr, td)
   - Table headers (th)
   - Table sections (thead, tbody, tfoot)
   - Spanning cells (colspan, rowspan)

3. Semantic HTML
   - Structural elements (header, footer, nav, main)
   - Content sectioning (article, section, aside)
   - Text semantics (time, mark, cite)
   - Accessibility benefits

## Code Examples
Refer to the following files in this directory:
- forms.html: Examples of different form elements and validation
- tables.html: Table structure and formatting
- semantic_elements.html: Proper use of semantic HTML

## Practice Exercises
1. Create a contact form with various input types and validation
2. Build a data table with headers and multiple rows/columns
3. Convert a div-based layout to use semantic HTML elements

## Notes
- Always include proper labels for form elements
- Use tables for tabular data only, not for layout
- Choose semantic elements based on content meaning, not appearance
